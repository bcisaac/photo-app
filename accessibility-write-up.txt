Accessibility

I only had to add a language to my html, so people would know what language my page was in. 
I also received warnings for having suspicious links, but these were all of the more links made 
to expand captions that were too long. 

To create alt tags for the posts, I just included details like who posted it and when. 

To make user-generated posts truly accessible, all users would need to label their posts or 
we would need machine learning algorithms to identify alt tags. 

I think my website is useable if I turn off CSS because a person could navigate it through 
tabs and act image has a tag. However, they would still not be able to discern what images 
people are positing, which I think defeats the whole purpose of my website. 

For this reason, I think my website is technically useable if I turn off the images, albeit a 
lot less exciting.
